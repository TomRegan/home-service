# Home Service
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/8hEPO2u.png" width=100 />

Home service is a collection of dotfiles and useful functions for bash. The `libexec` directory contains lazily loaded functions, and the `includes` directory contains configuration files.

The aims are as follows

* separate bash configuration into managable pieces
* reduce the time to login to a shell by sourcing slow-to-load scripts on demand

Contributions more than welcome.
